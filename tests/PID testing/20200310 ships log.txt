Started with hardcoded gains:

volatile float heading_Kp =0.0008333f;
volatile float heading_Ki =0.0f;
volatile float heading_Kd =0.0f;        

volatile float depth_Kp =0.005f;
volatile float depth_Ki =0.0f;
volatile float depth_Kd =0.0f;

volatile float pitch_Kp = 0.005f; //1.0f;
volatile float pitch_Ki = 0.0f; //10.0f;
volatile float pitch_Kd = 0.0f;  //0.0;



Heading was slow but effective.
Pitch was unable to reach settings.
Depth was able to come right up to edge of settings but easily drifted off of setting


Found pingponging at following gains:
Heading 0.01
Depth 0.02
Pitch 0.03

Pingponging recorded in videos:
vi_0013	Heading=50 (+depth 60 + pitch 0)
vi_0012 Depth=80 (+pitch 0)
vi_0011 Pitch=0

frame	~0.067
