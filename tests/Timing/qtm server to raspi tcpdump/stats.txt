# of samples may play a part in slightly tighter stats for GNBA-R.
# As seen in png images, most of the high RTT times occur during setup and teardown. 
# 	Sample time can do dilute those abnormal periods.
#	GNBA-R sampled for ~3x longer than Robotics due to Safety Standdown interruption.

# Close enough to consider 'the same' in my imo humbly.
