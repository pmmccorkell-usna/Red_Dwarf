Raw Serial Commands.
Entry into Python interface(s) will make a lot of this transparent and perform calculations to simplify user experience.

Movement
	sto:000		stops all controllers.
				xyz can be anything, convention is 000
	hea:xyz		xyz=[000,360] degrees
					xyz=999 stops heading controller, 
					[831,837] left/right
	vel:xyz		xyz=[0,800] ms PWM represents [1.1,1.9]ms
					xyz=999 stops speed controller
					[841,847] speed decrease/increase
	off:xyz		xyz=[0,360] degrees
					xyz=999 stops heading offset
					[851,857] offset left/right

Gains
	format: xy * 10^(z-5)
	Heading/Facing gains
		hkp:xyz
		hki:xyz
		hkd:xyz

BNO
	pos:00x		x[0,7], changes BNO programmed orientation (see datasheet)
	mod:00x		x[0,c], changes BNO sensor mode, ie Fusion vs. Magnetometer only (see datasheet)

mBed
	res:xyz		resets mBed
				xyz can be anything, convention 000

STOP
	STOP		Event Horizon
