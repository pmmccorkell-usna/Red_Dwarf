- Placement for "front" ?
	- If we maintain where it is now, boat-like movement gets kicked down road until somebody can do modeling and figure it out
- Hats
- BNO-055 drift:
	- EMI proof it (ThorLabs has sheets, FY21)
	- explore different IMUs (FY21)
- Power Reduction options:
	- move to 12V (order in FY21)
	- reduce blades on thruster (IIRC Alex Laun was working on something)
	- reduce surface area on blades (Dan designed a 3d printable lathe for blades and dremel tool)
	- ESC development (Joe)
- ESC cutoff switch
- Remote Estop (keep alive from a central hub/RasPi station integrated with the ESC cutoff?)
- LEDs to signal magnitude and direction to ESCs
- Seamless external power supply w/battery connected
	- low power schottky on external
	- resistor between Vcc and Gnd on external w/ high side tap for Vsense -- any voltage on Vsense = external power, turns off power mosfets on battery and ESC cutoff
- Redesign internal layout
	- BNO and MBed board on back of plate
	- placement for leak detector
	- batt, ESC, Pi on top of plate
	- separate with EMI foil
- Battery things:
	- INA226 power/current monitor
	- shunt resistor for INA226
	- read power monitoring on RasPi or 
	- temp shutoff
		- INA118 and read to RasPi
		or
		- PNP Q + Nch mosfet to switch off
- Port and clean up mbed code
	- move away from LPC1768
	- a lot of "if" statements I should have optimized into "switch"
- Redesign the mbed-bno-pwm breakout board
	- Part of internal layout
	- integrate battery monitor circuitry, ESC cutoff, leak detector
	- smaller footprint with something professionally printed
	- ideally dual use with UUV.
